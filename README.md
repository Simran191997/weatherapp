## How to Obtain Your API Key
To use the Weather App, you’ll need an API key from a weather data provider. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get one.

Step 1: Sign Up for a Weather API Provider
Choose a weather API provider, such as:
OpenWeatherMap (Free tier available)
WeatherAPI
AccuWeather
Create an account on the provider's website.
Complete any required verification process (e.g., email verification).
Step 2: Generate an API Key
After logging in, navigate to the API dashboard or developer console.
Look for a section like "API Keys" or "My API Keys."
Click "Create Key" or a similar option to generate your unique API key.
Step 3: Save Your API Key
Once generated, your API key will be displayed. Copy it and store it securely.
If you lose it, you may need to regenerate a new key from the API provider’s dashboard.
